# REST Noter API and Client

This repository contains client API and program for REST Noter API.

## What is included in this repo?

Simple Python codes providing both client API and a client program for REST Noter Backend.

## How to initialize API for further use?

`noter.py` needs to be initialized first for further use. To do it, just provide API URL using `setAPIUrl` function.
After this, all functions in the API will work properly (of course with proper data provided).
